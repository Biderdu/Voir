            Why do you use non-aerosol packaging?
          </div>
          <div class="description">
            We made the conscious decision to not house our products in aerosol packaging as these pressurized containers use propellant chemicals and can be flammable under certain temperatures. Instead we opted for innovative non-aerosol pumps for our dry shampoo and styling foam. The pump design is highly effective: smooth, mess-free, and a pleasure to use—plus it’s travel-friendly!
